plt.show()

# Because we have excluded free throws, this plot now shows us 
# the true representation of player style change. We can verify
# that this is the case because all the marks without exception
# on this plot are between 2 and 3. That is because Field Goals
# can only be for either 2 points or 3 points.
# The reason that Dwight Howard's Field Goal accuracy is so good is because he almost always
# scores 2-pointers only.
